    "system_response": "The post does not specifically mention a minimum CGPA requirement for the Thailand Government Scholarships 2025. However, it does mention that some scholarships may require additional commitments such as service commitments, research publications, or internships, but it does not provide detailed information on academic requirements like CGPA.\n\nTo get a clear understanding of the CGPA requirements, I would recommend checking the attached PDF database (https://lnkd.in/dxhq2Gdd) or visiting the official website of the host institutions, as they may have specific eligibility criteria and requirements for the scholarships. Additionally, you can also contact the universities or the Thai Government scholarship office directly to inquire about the CGPA requirements for the specific programs you are interested in.",
